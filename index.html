        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Accountant</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Tina Nguyen and I’m currently attending the University of California, Riverside. I am a freshman majoring in Pre-Business on track to entering the Business Administration Program with an Accounting concentration. I am also involved in the school’s Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) where I am an active member. During high school, I was in my school’s Associated Students Body (ASB) for 3 years where I was the student store manager and also treasurer. In these capacities, I was in charge of maintaining stock for the store, which includes ordering, keeping records of stock, and making a profit for the school. There is a tremendous importance in these positions because our ASB funded all of the school’s extracurricular events. Outside of school activities I have been a part of my local Girl Scout Troop for over a decade. In my troop I have been a team leader and also the Troop’s treasurer. This treasurer position gave me my first substantial experience with keeping meticulous financial records for an organization and maintaining a balance budget.<br><br>

        I also have an extensive amount of experience when it comes to working in an office environment. I have interned for a medical office in Fountain Valley, CA where my main duties were to take patients’ phone calls, schedule appointments, interact with patients in a professional manner when they arrive in person. Additionally, I also handled sensitive and confidential information related to a vast number of patients when I filed and organized all patient files. This internship experience gave me the confident in my ability to communicate with clients and handling sensitive information with the utmost professionalism.<br><br>

       In terms of employment, I have worked for a dessert shop called Matcha Café Maiko in Garden Grove, CA. During my short stint here before going off to college, I was given the responsibility of making drinks, handling payment, keeping the restaurant clean, and communicating with customers to make their experiences the best one possible. Here, I learned a lot about the intricacies of entrepreneurship. Since the franchisees were small business owners, I was able to witness how they were able to make their investment run efficiently. I also saw the amount of hard work that goes into maintaining profits for a small business.<br><br>
       
       As for my current place of employment, I am working for Raising Canes in Garden Grove, CA. The difference between Raising Canes and Matcha Café Maiko is that the former is a much bigger chain, has more name recognition, and therefore will operate differently from the latter. I hope to see more of what sets a business chain that spans across the country versus a more niche chain that caters mainly to customers from only one state. Knowing this difference will help me with my knowledge base since if I do want to start a business, I would love to have that business do well within the state and also grow exponentially so that the name is recognizable all around the country, and perhaps internationally as well.
